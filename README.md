# Learning C

This repository contains my personal journey into learning the C programming language.  
I'm using it to practice fundamentals, build small programs, and understand how things work under the hood.

## Goals

- Understand how C works at a low level  
- Learn how to compile programs with `gcc`  
- Practice writing clean, readable code  
- Explore pointers, memory, and data structures  
- Build small projects to reinforce concepts
